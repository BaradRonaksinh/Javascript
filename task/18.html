    <!-- What is a Loop and Switch Case in JavaScript define that ? -->

    <p>
        -> Switch case
        1. The switch expression is evaluated once.
        2. The value of the expression is compared with the values of each case.
        3. If there is a match, the associated block of code is executed.
        4. If there is no match, the default code block is executed.

        -> loop
        1. for - loops through a block of code a number of times
        2. for/in - loops through the properties of an object
        3. for/of - loops through the values of an iterable object
        4. while - loops through a block of code while a specified condition is true
        5. do/while - also loops through a block of code while a specified condition is true
