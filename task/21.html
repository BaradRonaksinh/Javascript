    <!-- What is the use of Void (0)? -->

    <p>
        The term "Void (0)" is commonly used in programming, particularly in JavaScript, to create a code snippet that
        evaluates to undefined. Here are a few key points about its use:

        Preventing Default Actions: It's often used in HTML to prevent a link from navigating to a new page or
        performing any default action. For example:

        html
        Copy code
        
        When this link is clicked, nothing happens because void(0) evaluates to undefined, preventing the default link
        behavior.
